# run.sh: measure one upgrade before and after its patch, free and offline, and print one JSON line
#   {"metric": ..., "before": ..., "after": ..., "pass": true|false, "extra": {...}}
# Usage (from an upgrade's test.sh): sh run.sh <upgrade dir> <metric key> '<pass rule in python over b, a>'
# The tree it measures is $P4_ROOT (the notebook's scratch copy) or this file's worktree. "after" is that tree's
# plugin as it stands (the patch applied by the caller); "before" is a copy with patch.diff reversed. Both migrate
# AudioPlugin-p4 and ap-p4_mac from the old-layout clones under $P4_FIXTURES with their own migrate.py, so a patch
# to the migration is measured too. Exit 0 either way; a failure to measure prints pass false with the error.
