"""
The p4 overrides as pathways, tested against their controls through the Claude API: does each always-on contract the
marketplace's plugins inject at SessionStart make Claude better than Anthropic's built-in behavior, or only longer?
For .docs/p4/overrides.md; the Colab notebook is .docs/p4/overrides_colab.ipynb (scripts/session/make_colab_notebook.py).

Units: every contract a plugin's SessionStart hook prints whole, found from the plugins' own hooks.json — a command
that cats a hooks/*.md, or a hooks/*.sh that names one (seed files, *-seed.md, are not contracts). Today that is
emission-discipline/emission-gate, src-fragger/src-fragger, vlds/memory-override and vlds/gc-contract. The hooks'
dynamic output (the recall digest, the standing rules, the prompt hook's lines) is a store's, not the repo's, and is
not measured here. With --skills, each plugin skill's SKILL.md is a unit too, measured alone only (a skill loads on
invocation, never at every session start).

Pathways (one model, one seed; every pathway sees the same tasks):
  builtin     the built-in stand-in alone: Claude Code's own system prompt is not published whole, so BUILTIN is a
              short stand-in, the same in every pathway; every number is relative to it
  all         builtin + every contract, in the plugins' order, as SessionStart hook context in the first user turn
  -<unit>     all without that unit: what the unit adds where the others already are
  +<unit>     builtin + that unit alone: what it adds on its own
  pad         builtin + neutral text as long as every contract together: the control for length alone
  ~<unit>     all with the unit replaced by an edited copy (--edits DIR, files named <unit with / as __>.md)
  =<name>     any context written elsewhere (--context-dir DIR, one pathway per *.md): the rebuild from blank pages
              uses it for its candidates, its trials and the rebuilt contracts

Tasks (overrides_tasks.jsonl): code (hidden tests run), fences (complete, parseable, no placeholders), honesty
(no fabricated facts, false premises caught), simple (right and short), format (exact form), judgment (the agent's
call, graded by a judge model), memory (earlier turns carry a retracted rule, a repeated request, a rule whose cause
is gone), and lessons (--extra-tasks: judged tasks a store's own recorded mistakes were turned into, train split
only). These are the accuracy the verdicts read. protocol tasks score whether a
contract's own conventions show (the Deviations block, a frag under src/) and are reported apart, since nothing but
the contract asks for them. Every answer to a general task is also scanned for the contracts' own vocabulary (JARGON);
the rate is reported per pathway, since words a contract invents leak into what users read. Each task carries a reference answer; --check-graders scores every reference (each
must pass) and every `bad` answer (each must fail) before anything is spent, so a grader fault is never read as a
pathway's.

Every answer lands in --cache as it arrives, keyed by model, pathway text, task and seed, so a run cut short
resumes there and nothing is asked twice. The input is counted with the API's free token counter first, and the
run stops before spending if the estimate is above --max-usd. --fake runs offline, for the tests and a smoke run:
every task gets its reference answer, except honesty and judgment tasks, which get their bad answer unless the
context carries FAKE-FIX:<category>; the fake judge passes only the reference.

Run:
  python scripts/session/overrides_suite.py --p4 . --tasks scripts/session/overrides_tasks.jsonl \
      --model claude-sonnet-5-5 --seed 0 --cache <dir> --out <json> [--pathways all,builtin,loo,solo,pad] \
